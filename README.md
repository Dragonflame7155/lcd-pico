### Setup
Connect Pins 0-11 on your raspberry pi pico to your 16 pin lcd display as follows:\
Pin 0 -> RS\
Pin 1 -> RW\
Pin 2 -> E\
Pin 3 -> D0\
Pin 4 -> D1\
Pin 5 -> D2\
Pin 6 -> D3\
Pin 7 -> D4\
Pin 8 -> D5\
Pin 9 -> D6\
Pin 10 -> D7\
(And remember to connect VDD and A to 5 volts, and VSS and K to ground. connect 5 volts and ground to a potentiometer, and push to output to VO (for contrast control))\
Now you can import the driver with `import lcd` and prefixing commands with `lcd.`
